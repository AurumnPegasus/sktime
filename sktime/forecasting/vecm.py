class VECM(_StatsModelsAdapter):
    r"""
    A VECM model, or Vector Error Correction Model, is a restricted.

    VAR model used for nonstationary series that are cointegrated.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dates : array_like of datetime, optional
        See :class:`statsmodels.tsa.base.tsa_model.TimeSeriesModel` for more
        information.
    freq : str, optional
        See :class:`statsmodels.tsa.base.tsa_model.TimeSeriesModel` for more
        information.
    missing : str, optional
        See :class:`statsmodels.base.model.Model` for more information.
    k_ar_diff : int
        Number of lagged differences in the model. Equals :math:`k_{ar} - 1` in
        the formula above.
    coint_rank : int
        Cointegration rank, equals the rank of the matrix :math:`\\Pi` and the
        number of columns of :math:`\\alpha` and :math:`\\beta`.
    deterministic : str {``"n"``, ``"co"``, ``"ci"``, ``"lo"``, ``"li"``}
        * ``"n"`` - no deterministic terms
        * ``"co"`` - constant outside the cointegration relation
        * ``"ci"`` - constant within the cointegration relation
        * ``"lo"`` - linear trend outside the cointegration relation
        * ``"li"`` - linear trend within the cointegration relation

        Combinations of these are possible (e.g. ``"cili"`` or ``"colo"`` for
        linear trend with intercept). When using a constant term you have to
        choose whether you want to restrict it to the cointegration relation
        (i.e. ``"ci"``) or leave it unrestricted (i.e. ``"co"``). Do not use
        both ``"ci"`` and ``"co"``. The same applies for ``"li"`` and ``"lo"``
        when using a linear term. See the Notes-section for more information.
    seasons : int, default: 0
        Number of periods in a seasonal cycle. 0 means no seasons.
    first_season : int, default: 0
        Season of the first observation.
    method : str {"ml"}, default: "ml"
        Estimation method to use. "ml" stands for Maximum Likelihood.

        # Testing parameters can be dictionary or list of dictionaries
        # Testing parameter choice should cover internal cases well.
        #
        # this method can, if required, use:
        #   class properties (e.g., inherited); parent class test case
        #   imported objects such as estimators from sktime or sklearn
        # important: all such imports should be *inside get_test_params*, not at the top
        #            since imports are used only at testing time
        #
        # The parameter_set argument is not used for automated, module level tests.
        #   It can be used in custom, estimator specific tests, for "special" settings.
        # A parameter dictionary must be returned *for all values* of parameter_set,
        #   i.e., "parameter_set not available" errors should never be raised.
        #
        # example 1: specify params as dictionary
        # any number of params can be specified
        # params = {"est": value0, "parama": value1, "paramb": value2}
        #
        # example 2: specify params as list of dictionary
        # note: Only first dictionary will be used by create_test_instance
        # params = [{"est": value1, "parama": value2},
        #           {"est": value3, "parama": value4}]
        # return params
        #
        # example 3: parameter set depending on param_set value
        #   note: only needed if a separate parameter set is needed in tests
        # if parameter_set == "special_param_set":
        #     params = {"est": value1, "parama": value2}
        #     return params
        #
        # # "default" params - always returned except for "special_param_set" value
        # params = {"est": value3, "parama": value4}
        # return params
